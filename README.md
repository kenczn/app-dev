Prison Break
: Due to a political conspiracy, an innocent man is sent to death row and his only hope is his brother, who makes it his mission to deliberately get himself sent to the same prison in order to break the both of them out, from the inside.

Breaking Bad
: The series explores how a fatal diagnosis such as White's releases a typical man from the daily concerns and constraints of normal society and follows his transformation from mild family man to a kingpin of the drug trade. Mild-mannered high school chemistry teacher Walter White thinks his life can't get much worse.

One Piece
: One Piece is the story of Monkey D. Luffy, a young man who has a single dream: To find the legendary treasure known as the One Piece and become the King of the Pirates. Alongside a crew of trusted friends, Luffy sails the dangerous seas of the Grand Line to find Laugh Tale, the hidden island containing the One Piece.

Vikings
: The series tells the saga of Ragnar's band of Viking brothers and his family as he rises to become King of the Viking tribes. As well as being a fearless warrior, Ragnar embodies the Norse traditions of devotion to the gods: legend has it that he was a direct descendant of Odin, the god of war and warriors.

Peaky Blinders
: The Peaky Blinders were a street gang based in Birmingham, England, which operated from the 1880s until the 1910s. The group, which grew out of the harsh economic deprivations of working-class Britain, consisted largely of young criminals from lower- to middle-class backgrounds.
